===================================

Overview
--------

Please help the software projects you use and love.

You can support the BorgBackup Project using these options:

- `PayPal Donation to Waldmann EDV <https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=58A7SUQJZLBQ8>`_
- `BorgBackup Team on Liberapay <https://liberapay.com/borgbackup/donate>`_
- `BorgBackup Team on BountySource <https://www.bountysource.com/teams/borgbackup>`_

PayPal
------

PayPal Donations are maybe the easiest way (if you already use PayPal or a credit card)
to directly support a specific developer.

Waldmann EDV is the company of Thomas Waldmann, borgbackup's main developer and maintainer.

Liberapay
---------

On Liberapay, you can become a Patron and support us on a regular basis to
create a long term sustainable project.

The funds are distributed to the borgbackup team members and as a borgbackup
developer you can join the team.

BountySource
------------

You can give general funds to the borgbackup members (the developers will
then spend the funds as they deem fit, usually to create bounties).

A bounty is a reward for whoever fixes a specific issue, e.g. to fix a bug,
update the docs, implement a feature, ...

You can use the above, if you do not have some specific bounty (see below).

If you want to encourage developers to fix some specific issue or implement some
specific feature suggestion, you can post a new bounty or back an existing one
(they always refer to an issue in our issue tracker).

As a developer, you can become a Bounty Hunter and win bounties (earn money).
