Support
=======

Please first read the docs, the existing issue tracker issues and mailing
list posts -- a lot of stuff is already documented / explained / discussed /
filed there.

.. _docs:

Documentation
-------------

We have quite nice docs including:

- installation
- reference of borg commands
- examples and a FAQ
- internals docs
- docs for developers

.. _issue_tracker:

Issue Tracker
-------------

If you've found a bug or have a concrete feature request, please create a new
ticket on the project's `issue tracker
<https://www.github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues>`_.

For more general questions or discussions, IRC or mailing list are preferred.

.. _chat_irc:

Chat (IRC)
----------

Join us on channel #borgbackup on libera.chat.

As usual on IRC, just ask or tell directly and then patiently wait for replies.
Stay connected.

Using a IRC client and a registered nick is the preferred way to use our channel.

In times of high spammer activity, the registered nick might be even required to
join our channel.

You could also use the web based IRC client, choose some nickname and join our
channel (you might still need a registered nick to join our channel, see above):

`#borgbackup channel web IRC <https://web.libera.chat/?nick=Guest&#borgbackup>`_

.. _matrix:

Matrix Chat
-----------

You can also use a matrix protocol based chat client like e.g.
`Element <https://app.element.io>`_ to join the
`#borgbackup room <https://matrix.to/#/!KnTJxMbCJuuVyjTSeJ:libera.chat?via=libera.chat&via=matrix.org&via=rudd-o.com>`_.

Note: This room is bridged to the #borgbackup IRC channel on libera.chat.

.. _mailing_list:

Mailing list
------------

To find out about the mailing list, its topic, how to subscribe, how to
unsubscribe and where you can find the archives of the list, see the
`mailing list homepage
<https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/borgbackup>`_.

.. _twitter:

.. _mastodon:

Mastodon / Twitter / X
-----------------------

Follow us there for announcements:

- Mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@borgbackup
- Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/borgbackup

Please understand that Twitter/X and mastodon are not suitable for longer / more
complex discussions - use one of the other channels for that.

.. _bounties_and_fundraisers:
